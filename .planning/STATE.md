# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-20)

**Core value:** Every dollar billed and collected is automatically traceable
to the applicable agreement version, verified revenue evidence, deterministic
calculation, invoice, payment-provider event, settlement, and collections
history.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — executable-financial-test-and-release-gate

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (executable-financial-test-and-release-gate) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 10
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-25

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 16 min
- Total execution time: 0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 | 2 | 32 min | 16 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 8 min, 24 min
- Trend: Establishing baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P01 | 8min | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 24min | 3 tasks | 7 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Use Horizontal Layers for this infrastructure-heavy financial system.
- [Roadmap]: Preserve the audited hard dependency chain; parallelism is allowed only within proven boundaries.
- [Phase 01]: Release policy and receipt contracts are authoritative for every later financial CI and deployment lane. — A single machine-readable contract prevents local, CI, and release behavior from drifting.
- [Phase 01]: Only classified local-stack bootstrap failures may retry once; financial assertions never retry. — Deterministic assertion failures must remain visible and cannot be masked by automatic reruns.
- [Phase 01]: Schema-push authority is created internally as a uniquely named loopback Supabase project; caller-supplied URLs, tokens, links, and project refs are rejected before mutation. — The mandatory push proof cannot accidentally target shared or production infrastructure.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- The repository has unrelated pre-existing uncommitted scan artifacts and source changes; isolate them before phase execution.
