# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-20)

**Core value:** Every dollar billed and collected is automatically traceable
to the applicable agreement version, verified revenue evidence, deterministic
calculation, invoice, payment-provider event, settlement, and collections
history.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — executable-financial-test-and-release-gate

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (executable-financial-test-and-release-gate) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Use Horizontal Layers for this infrastructure-heavy financial system.
- [Roadmap]: Preserve the audited hard dependency chain; parallelism is allowed only within proven boundaries.
- [Phase 01]: Release policy and receipt contracts are authoritative for every later financial CI and deployment lane. — A single machine-readable contract prevents local, CI, and release behavior from drifting.
- [Phase 01]: Only classified local-stack bootstrap failures may retry once; financial assertions never retry. — Deterministic assertion failures must remain visible and cannot be masked by automatic reruns.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- The repository has unrelated pre-existing uncommitted scan artifacts and source changes; isolate them before phase execution.
